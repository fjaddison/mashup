## Nouns Mashup Generator

To learn more about blockchain development and to dip my toes back into web development, I've decided to mae a project utilizing [Nouns](nouns.wtf). Nouns are a CC0 NFT project built of composable SVG that is rendered entirely on the blockchain, free from external dependencies. Nouns are also open source, meaning anyone can build on top of the existing IP and smart contract infrastructure. 

To make the project a little more fun, I want to incorporate another on-chain NFT project in order to make a mashup of composable parts read entirely from the blockchain. This is not an NFT project, it's solely a front-end that makes use of smart contract function calls to render SVG. Users can endlessly compose their own Nouns and save their outputs. It's a very simple application.

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/api-reference/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/routing/api-routes) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.js`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/routing/api-routes) instead of React pages.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.
